## 🎯 The Meta-Orchestration Promise

**"Even when you're not mentally in it, the system ensures your content maintains the same quality, depth, and balanced perspective that your audience expects."**

This system consolidates:
- ✅ Content creation (GPT integration)
- ✅ Analysis and bias checking (Contra)
- ✅ Voice and perspective generation (Skitz/Voice cloning)
- ✅ Dashboard consolidation (Trading dashboard)
- ✅ State monitoring (BSI scale)
- ✅ Quality assurance (Meta orchestration)

## 🔧 Quick Setup

1. **View System**: Open `index.html` in browser
2. **Run Analysis**: Use `python analysis/contra.py` for bias checking
3. **Check BSI**: Use `python analysis/bsi_repath.py` for re-pathing
4. **Generate Voices**: Run voice cloning scripts in `voiceclone/`
5. **Access Dashboard**: Open `trading_dashboard/dashboard`

## 📚 Historical Learning

The system learns from validated cases:
- **Low BSI Reference Case**: Anisimova vs Sabalenka (Eyes Never Lie lesson)
